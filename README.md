# Financial Analysis Script for PyBank

## Overview
This script analyzes financial records from a CSV file named `budget_data.csv`. It computes various financial metrics, including the total number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of profits/losses over the entire period, the average change in profits/losses, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits along with their respective dates.

## Features/Steps
- Calculates the total number of months included in the dataset
- Computes the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Determines the average change in "Profit/Losses"
- Identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits, including the dates


## File Structure (Feel Free to adjust the file paths set at the beginning of the code, if needed )
- `budget_data.csv`: The CSV file containing the financial data to be analyzed. It should have two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
- `financial_analysis_summary.txt`: The output file where the analysis summary is saved.

## How to Use
1. Ensure that the `budget_data.csv` file is placed in the directory `Module 3 Challenge/PyBank/Resources/` or change the file paths as needed.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
3. The script will print the financial analysis to the terminal and also save it to `Module 3 Challenge/PyBank/Analysis/financial_analysis_summary.txt` as default or your desired path.  

## Output Format
The script outputs the analysis in the following format:

```
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: [total_months]
Total: $[total_profit_loss]
Average Change: $[average_change]
Greatest Increase in Profits: [date] ($[amount])
Greatest Decrease in Profits: [date] ($[amount])
```






# Election Analysis Script

## Overview
This Python script is designed to analyze election data from a CSV file called 'election_data.csv'. It calculates the total number of votes cast in the election, lists all candidates who received votes, calculates the percentage and total number of votes each candidate won, and determines the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Features/Steps
- Reads election data from a CSV file
- Counts total votes cast
- Identifies each candidate who received votes
- Calculates the percentage of votes each candidate won
- Determines the total number of votes for each candidate
- Identifies the winner of the election


## How to Use
1. Place the election data file (`election_data.csv`) in the same directory as the script, or modify the `file_path` variable in the script to point to the location of the CSV file.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
3. The script will print the election results to the terminal and save a summary of the results to a text file (`Election_Results.txt`).

## Output
The script outputs the election results in the following format:

```
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: [total_votes]
-------------------------
[candidate_name]: [percentage]% ([votes])
...
-------------------------
Winner: [winner]
-------------------------
```

This summary is both printed to the terminal and saved to `Election_Results.txt`.
